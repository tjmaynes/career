\begin{itemize}
    \item Lead engineer on a backend service that automated the management and distribution of program metadata across many vendors and partners. We were able to save our business unit millions of dollars by automating this manual, tedious and error-prone task. The service was written in Clojure, deployed to AWS ECS with data stored on AWS RDS and Elasticsearch.
    \item Lead engineer on a web application that showed Spanish and English 2017 World Cup viewers how to authenticate with their MVPD provider to watch World Cup games on Telemundo. At peak, this resulted in millions of informed viewers. The web app used server-side rendered (SSR) React and was deployed to AWS ECS and AWS S3.
    \item Developed a backend-for-frontend (BFF) service for the MSNBC, Syfy, Telemundo, USA iOS applications which resulted in increasing feature development speed, shortened release cycles, and a simpler iOS networking architecture. The service was written in Elixir, deployed to AWS ECS with data stored on AWS RDS.

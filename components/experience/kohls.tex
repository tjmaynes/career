\begin{itemize}
    \item I designed, developed, and deployed the Kohl's Shared Analytics library including a documentation site to production. As an outcome of this effort, we reduced the cost to managing analytics events across Kohl's webstore teams in their respective codebases.
    \item I co-organize and coach XP pair programming workshops for Kohls Technology (KT) teams. As an outcome of this effort, I'm enabling KT teams to grow their XP practices and building a community of XP practitioners across Kohls.
%     \item I designed, developed, and deployed a Javascript-based solution to show ad campaigns on the Home screen of the Kohl's iOS and Android applications. As an outcome of this new functionality, the Kohl's Media Network (KMN) team is now able to run ads on the Kohl's iOS and Android applications which produced more ad-revenue for Kohls.

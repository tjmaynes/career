  {\textsl \textbf{Admin Console web interface for internal use}} \hfill Jul 2022 - Dec 2022 \\ InDebted \hfill B2B2C
  We designed, built and managed a React(TypeScript)-based Web application that was deployed to AWS Amplify using Terraform. Also, we built a backend in Go and deployed to AWS Lambda using Terraform and Serverless framework. The most exciting part about this application was build the email capturing workflow, where we had to design and build an AWS SES -> AWS S3 -> AWS SQS workflow to asynchronously capture emails that were sent from SendGrid to our customers. This email capture workflow enabled us to display the actual email (in HTML format) in an iFrame in the "Admin Console" web application.

  {\textsl CannyBot} \\ Team Leader \hfill February 2015 -- May 2015
  \begin{itemize}
    \item With another student, I programmed the NAO Robot to draw shapes that it \textit{sees} using the Python programming language and OpenCV. Concepts such as edge detection, pixel position interpolation, and forward kinematics were implemented in this project.
